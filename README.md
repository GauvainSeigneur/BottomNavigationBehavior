# BottomNavigationBehavior

## Synopsis 

I use BottomNavigationWidget but Google doesn't provide behavior like we can see in Google Material Guidelines. So I Made a behavior and applied it on BottomNavigationView.

## How

I define a behavior wich is like bottomsheetbehavior when it's hiding or expdand. 

## What it does ? 

* Hide/expand on scroll
* Fixed mode
* Manage snackbar and FAB in all state (expanded, hidden or settling)

## TODO

* Correct bug of fab when snackbar is dimissed
* Circular background color reveal
* Disable shift by xml parameter
